# last-fm

This project uses Last.fm's API to display a donut chart of top artists. Mousing over a section of the donut chart displays an artist's name. If an artist's slice of the chart is clicked, the user can view the artist's top 10 tracks. Mousing over a track's rectangle displays the number of listeners and the number of plays. The Google Maps API is used to map the artist's next 10 events. Mousing over a map marker displays the event name and date.
